Description: Implements methods for calculating lifetime risk estimates from survival data
    with proper handling of competing risks. The package provides tools for person-year
    calculations, age-specific incidence rates, cumulative incidence with competing
    risks, and age-adjusted rates. Methods follow established epidemiological approaches
    for accurate risk estimation across different age groups and populations.
