\title{Extract Number at Risk from Lifetable Analysis}
\usage{
get_number_at_risk_from_analysis(
  analysis_obj,
  group1_label = "Group 1",
  group2_label = "Group 2",
  age_points = c(50, 60, 70, 80, 90)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{analysis_obj}{An object returned by pie_analysis}

\item{group1_label}{Label for group1 in the output}

\item{group2_label}{Label for group2 in the output}

\item{age_points}{Vector of age points at which to display counts}
}
\value{
A dataframe with number at risk by group and age
}
\description{
Extracts the number at risk at specified ages for each group from a pie_analysis result.
}
\details{
Requires that pie_analysis was run with debug=TRUE and that summary datasets (SDS1, SDS2) are available in the global environment.
}
\examples{
# Only works if SDS1 and SDS2 exist in global environment
}
